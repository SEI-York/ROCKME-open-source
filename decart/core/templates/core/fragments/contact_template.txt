This is a template for rendering a support email from a user.
At present all emails are being directed to the core DeCart gitlab support
desk but this is configurable within `core`.

TODO :: See about locating this with the project templates directory in
        order to allow for the `core` DeCart views to access site wide config
        without having to edit the templates in `core`.
